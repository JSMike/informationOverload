# Information Overload

This project was created as a presentation for CSC5930 - Information Security at Villanova University.

The site is currently being hosted here: [http://mcebrian.com:5930](http://mcebrian.com:5930)

The goal of the project is to show the metadata available to developers when someone logs into their website.

When the demo site is running the end users can log in with Facebook, Twitter, Google+, or any e-mail/password.

After logging in the end-user will be provided a delete button to delete any records that may have been stored from your session.

This is for educational use only.
